## How to Use This File

1. **Before starting work**: Review validated optimizations to apply proven patterns
2. **During experimentation**: Check failed optimizations to avoid repeating mistakes
3. **When stuck**: Look at cross-cutting insights for general guidance
4. **After experiments**: Update this file with new learnings from EXPERIMENTS-LOG.md

This file should be updated after completing each experiment to capture insights while they're fresh.
